This repository contains the code used to write the manuscript entitled "Using Tree-Based Models to Identify Factors Contributing to Trait Negative Affect in Adults with and without Major Depression." However, as the data is not publicly available, the code cannot be executed. If you have any questions, please contact me at ccani007@fiu.edu.

The repository includes the following files:

+ 20230202_script_regression_tree.Rmd: This file contains the code used to wrangle the data and create the regression tree.
